# `path`: a lambda calculus to explore type-directed program synthesis

`path` was initially based on the calculus described in _[A tutorial implementation of a dependently typed lambda calculus][]_. It has been extended with the quantitative type theory described in _[Syntax and Semantics of Quantitative Type Theory][]_.
